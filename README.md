## 🧠 About Me  

I’m a **Full Stack SaaS developer** who builds complete digital products — from idea to production.  
I design systems end-to-end: clean interfaces, scalable backends, intelligent logic, and real-world usable platforms.

My focus is on building **products that actually solve problems**, not just projects:
- SaaS platforms  
- AI-powered systems  
- Automation tools  
- Scalable applications  
- Startup-grade architectures  

I love working where **engineering meets impact** — where code becomes something people actually use.

Currently open to:
- **Summer 2026 Internships**
- **2026–2027 Industrial Placements**
- **Freelance & short-term SaaS / backend / AI projects**
- **Startup collaborations**

## 🌱 Vision  

I’m building toward becoming a **product-focused engineer** — someone who doesn’t just write code, but creates systems, platforms, and companies.

My long-term path:
> Engineer → Builder → Founder → Ecosystem Creator  

Technology for me isn’t just engineering —  
it’s **leverage, freedom, scale, and creation**.
