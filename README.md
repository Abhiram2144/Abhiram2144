## About Me  

I’m a Computer Science postgraduate student with hands-on experience building backend systems, automation tools, and data-driven applications. I enjoy designing systems end-to-end — from APIs and data pipelines to logic that supports real-world decision-making.

My interests lie at the intersection of **software engineering, AI, and automation**, especially where technology can reduce manual effort, improve efficiency, and scale reliably. I’m comfortable learning new tools quickly, working through ambiguity, and collaborating across technical and non-technical teams.

I’m currently seeking **Summer 2026 internships**, **2026–2027 industrial placements**, and I’m also **open to freelance or short-term project-based work**, particularly in backend development, automation, and data-driven systems.

**Languages & Development**
- Python, JavaScript (Node.js), SQL  
- Backend APIs (REST, FastAPI, Express)  
- Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures  

**Software Engineering**
- System design fundamentals  
- Version control (Git/GitHub)  
- Debugging, documentation, and clean code practices  
- Agile & collaborative development  

**Data, AI & Automation**
- Data processing (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Machine learning foundations (scikit-learn, PyTorch exposure)  
- Feature engineering & evaluation  
- Workflow automation and internal tools

## Selected Projects  

### 🔹 Communication Medium for University  
Built a full-stack progressive web application to enable real-time, module-based communication for university students. The system includes secure OTP authentication, automated channel enrolment based on academic profiles, and an AI-powered moderation layer to maintain relevance in academic discussions. Designed for scalability and real-time messaging using modern backend architecture.

### 🔹 AI-Based Outfit Recommendation System  
Developed a personalised outfit recommendation engine using deep learning and vision models. The project uses CLIP embeddings to align clothing images with user attributes such as skin tone, body type, and style preferences, producing ranked outfit recommendations. Focused on model quality, evaluation workflows, and practical ML system design.

### 🔹 Retail Sales Forecasting & Analytics Dashboard  
Worked on a data science project analysing large retail datasets to forecast sales trends. Built end-to-end pipelines for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, and presented insights through interactive dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

## What I’m Looking For  

I’m particularly interested in roles involving:
- Backend systems and internal tooling  
- Automation and AI-assisted workflows  
- Data-driven software and decision-support systems  

I value environments where learning, ownership, and practical impact matter.
